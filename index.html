                <h3>"Why I am learning in this school, how I hope it helps me in the future, who I want to be when I grow up"</h3>

                <p>One of my favourite things about programming is problem solving as it can be very rewarding. Just the feeling of finally finding the solution gives that dopamine, which makes it fun and engaging and on top of that the possibility of getting paid.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Before choosing the Tallinn Polytechnic School I tried out python for the first time with the help of my brother and liked it. I also didn't like that in gymnasium (school) they teach little to no profession subjects, which adds at least 3 years of learning subjects I'm not interested in. By learning basics of programming and its different branches I hope to find what I will enjoy and start focusing on it. After graduating i hope to apply for universities like TalTech and start getting into specifics, rather than writing simple programs and API's.</p>

                <br>

                <p>As of now it's hard to tell since in previous courses we were only taught about web development. In the future I would like to be doing software development.</p>
